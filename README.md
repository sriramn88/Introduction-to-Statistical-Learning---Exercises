# Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning---Exercises

I will cover the Introduction to Statistical Learning exercises by James, Witten et.al. The initial chapter will contain methods to present large datasets, deriving the summary statistics. I will use the SciPy and Scikit-learn libraries to perform supervised learning methods on large datasets. I will use the libraries to run Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and feature selection methods like Lasso Regression while performing cross-validation on these methods. I will also look at classification models like Logistic Regression, Multinomial-Logistic Regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. 

I will also look at non-linear models like Trees, Support Vector Machines(SVM), and ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, random forest, and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees(BART). I will look at Principal Component Analysis(PCA), semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised learning models as part of these exercises.
